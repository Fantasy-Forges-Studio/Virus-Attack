# Virus Attack

This is just a small game that I made. Its a short game where you build up white blood cell counts and their weaponry against the viruses. There are still many features for me to add and hopefully I will continue to do so. For now though this is what it is. To do much in the way of adding to it I will most likely need to redo my code. This was before I learned some better methods for some of what I did.

Anyway I hope you guys enjoy. I enjoy the game as well as making it. I hope you guys enjoy it as well.

This studio will be doing more as time goes on as well so stay tuned. If this game isnt for you then dont worry. We are working on more.
